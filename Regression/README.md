### Regression:
Linear Regression: If one dependent variable (y) depend on independent variable (x) is know as Regression. \
Type of Linear Regression.  
There are two types of linear regression.           
1. Linear Regression with one Variable. [x].                   
2. Lineaar Regression with more than one Variable. [x1,x2,x3 ... xn]. 

### Equation of Linear Reression With one Variable.
*Y = mx + c.* where Y = output/predict value, X is input. 

### Equation with Multiple Variable.
*Y = m[X1+X2+....Xn] + c.* where Y = output/predict value, Xs are inputs.
